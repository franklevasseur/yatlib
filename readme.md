# YATLIB

## Stands for Yet Another Test Lib

### Why ?

Glad you asked !

Because I believe, deep down in my heart, that Jest terribly sucks and is directly responsible for the loss of years of my life that I will never get back.

### Made for programmers who meet one or more of these criterias

- Likes Typescript
- Likes **For loops** and **Functions** (\*\***WOW**\*\*)
- Likes logging text messages in the terminal using good old fashion `console.log`s
- Doesn't like when a program swallows logs sent to the terminal
- Doesn't like when a library needs 100000 other libs to run
- Doesn't like when a library needs to "_transform_" with babel to even run your code
- Prefers coding than browsing Stack Overflow
- Doesn't mind importing the dependencies it uses

Basically,

YATLIB does **less** than Jest.

# Disclaimer ⚠️

YATLIB is still very early in its development and is subject to massive breaking changes.
